# K-Nearest-Neighbors
>The k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.This algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining and intrusion detection.
   
>Here is the implementation of KNN algorithm in python which takes value of the "k" and "SPECT" dataset as inputs.Accuracy in percentage,precisions and recalls are the outputs.
